# 👋 Hi, I'm Harsha Vardhan Dasari!


## 🚀 About Me
I’m a passionate AI researcher and developer currently pursuing my MS in Computer Science at **Stevens Institute of Technology** (GPA: 3.95). My interests lie at the intersection of **machine learning, deep learning, NLP, computer vision**, and **computational science applications**.

I enjoy solving real-world problems using AI — from financial complaint classification to bankruptcy forecasting, and cutting-edge PDE modeling using meta-learning.
